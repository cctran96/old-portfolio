                    Hi, my name is Chau, and I have a love for developing comprehensive applications that maxmimize user experience. 
                    My journey started in December of 2020 where I began to delve into the world of coding. 
                    I first learned the basics of Python, solving algorithms on my free time. 
                    I transitioned to Javascript and Ruby as I wanted learn the ins and outs of both frontend and backend development.
                </p>
